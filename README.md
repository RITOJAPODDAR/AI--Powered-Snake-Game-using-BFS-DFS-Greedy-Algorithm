# 🐍 AI-Powered Snake Game using BFS, DFS & Greedy Algorithm

This is a simple AI-powered version of the classic Snake Game developed in Python. The game features different pathfinding strategies like **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and a basic **Greedy Algorithm** to help the snake find food intelligently.

## 📌 Project Highlights

- AI-driven snake movement
- Implements:
  - 🔵 Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - 🟢 Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - 🟡 Greedy Algorithm
- Basic visual interface
- Educational and beginner-friendly Python code

Install dependencies:

-> pip install pygame

🧠 Algorithms Used
BFS: Finds shortest path in a level-wise manner.

DFS: Explores deeper paths first.

Greedy: Moves in the direction that looks closest to food.
